## Intro
This is my bulletin application to learn redux. In this branch I add the async functions for reaching out to jsonplaceholder for post titles, content, and authors. Also I add in the ability to create, update, and delete posts. While I followed the tutorial closely, I made some modifications of my own.

## How to
